      <h3 id="beginner" style="font-size: 50px; margin-top: 150px;">Beginner</h3>
      <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;">Easy beginner exercises, for those who just started to learn Python.</p>

      <h4>Hello World!</h4>

        <p>Code a program, where the user inputs a number. Then this number is added with 5 and printed out</p> 
        <p>Code a program, where the user inputs 3 numbers. The program adds this numbers and prints them out.<br> (a + b + c = d)</p> 

      <h4>Kid or adult?</h4>
        <p>Code a program, where the user inputs his age. When he's older than 18 it should say: "You're an adult".

      <h4>Login</h4>
        <p>Code a program, where the user inputs a username and a password (the password is "Python"). When the password is right the the program should welcome the username. When not the program should quit</p> 

      <h4>1,2,3,4,5...</h4>
        <p>Code a program, that prints out all number's from 1 to 10 individually."</p> 
        <p>Let several users input their name and age. Then print out the result like this: [name: age] Each name should apperear on a new line.</p>

      <h3 id="intermediate" style="font-size: 50px; margin-top: 150px;">Intermediate</h3>

      <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;">Demanding tasks, that create little, useful programs.</p>

      <h4>Calculator</h4>
        <p>Code a program, where the user inputs what kind of calculation he wants to make (+,-,*,/). Then he inputs 2 numbers and the result has to be calculated. Make sure, that he can't divide by 0.</p> 
        <p>Code a program, that looks how many times a number is twice in a list Then the second number has to be sorted out. Here's the list:<br>[1,3,5.5,56,34,232,56,78,3,29,34,5.5]</p>
      <h4>Numbers</h4>
        <p>Code a program, that sorts all numbers in a list and then substracts all numbers from the biggest to the smallest one. Here's the list:<br>
        [45,23,6,2,77,2,3,52,244,235,55,22]</p> 
        <p>Ask the user to enter a range of numbers (e.g 1 to 10). Then a random number in this range should be created and printed out.</p>
      <h4>Odd or Even?</h4>
        <p>Code a program where the user inputs a number. The program checks whether the number is odd or even. (Google modulo for help)</p> 
        <p>Code a program, that checks how many numbers are in a list, that you can divide by 5. Here's the list:<br>
